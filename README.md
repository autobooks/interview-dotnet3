This project is meant to display a familiarity with a vast array of technical aspects related to software development.

_Disclaimer: In my current role we are not taking advantage of all industry best practices. Several of these tools were used for the first time in this application._

Regarding the promp,

-   Requiremetns - I feel I covered the requirements for unequivocally cover the items stated.
-   Expectations - This project will undoubtedly exceed expectations in terms of breadth and depth
-   Publish - The source will be published to my github. However, I wanted to present some knowledge of databases rather than mock it with a collection in memory. As such, it cannot be served through a static service like Github-Pages. In order to publish a working example, I would need to establish subscriptions for data and resource hosting, which I'm hoping is outside the scope of this project. I will elaborate more on the choice in the wiki.
-   Testing pipeline - Test Passage is included in the 'Push' Github action. Test Coverage is NOT. The way in which I examine test coverage is also explained more fully in the wiki.
